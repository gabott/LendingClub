## General Information
- In a consumer finance company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company             receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile.
- Exploratory Data Analysis 
- Based on customer information about past loan applicants and whether they ‘defaulted’ or not. The aim is to identify patterns     which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the       amount of loan, lending at a higher interest rate.
- Loan Data Set
